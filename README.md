# Bank Management System (C++)

A console-based Bank Management System developed in C++ that simulates core banking operations using structured data and persistent file handling.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of structured programming, file I/O operations, and basic financial transaction logic within a modular command-line application.

# Key Features

Open New Account – Create and store customer account records persistently

Send Money – Perform secure balance transfers between accounts

Show All Accounts – Display stored account information

Show Transactions – View transaction history

Delete All Accounts – Reset system records

Quit – Exit the application safely

# Technical Implementation

Built using C++

Data modeled using struct for account and transaction management

Persistent storage implemented via file handling (fstream)

Sequential file operations for reading and writing account data

Basic validation and transaction consistency logic

Learning Objectives Demonstrated

Structured data modeling

File-based data persistence

Console-based menu-driven system design

Transaction processing logic

Fundamental banking workflow simulation

# Scope

This project focuses on demonstrating core programming and data management concepts rather than production-grade banking security or database integration.
